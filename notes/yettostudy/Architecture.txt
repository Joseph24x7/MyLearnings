4. CSRF and CORS.

CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery): Imagine if you are logged into your bank account, and you receive an email with a link that says "Click here to see cute cat pictures." You click the link, and it actually transfers money from your bank account to the attacker's account. This is CSRF.

CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing): CORS is a set of rules that helps your website specify which other websites are allowed to access its resources (like images, scripts, or data) in a web browser.
