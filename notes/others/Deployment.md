# Deployment and Container Platforms

## 1. Use of Argo CD?
- Argo CD is mainly for GitOps (deployments/config sync), not for logs.

## 2. Why in Azure - Azure Red Hat OpenShift?
- That means Microsoft Azure + Red Hat together provide a managed OpenShift service.
- Instead of you setting up OpenShift manually, Azure hosts it for you (scaling, security patches, cluster upgrades, integrations with Azure Monitor, etc.).

## 3. What is OpenShift Container Platform 4 (OCP4)?
- It’s Red Hat’s Kubernetes-based platform for running containers and microservices.

## 4. Azure + OCP4 Integration in my current project
- Managed OpenShift cluster running inside Azure’s cloud.
