Below is a **clean grouping of all questions by topic**, as requested.
(No answers, only categorization.)

## **Concurrency & Asynchronous Programming**

* Notify vs NotifyAll
* Reactive programming
* Spring WebFlux advantages
* Platform threads vs Virtual Threads
* Executor Service role in threads
* ThreadPoolExecutor role in threads
* How to set thread pool configurations
* HashMap vs ConcurrentHashMap - why HashMap is faster
* Hashmap vs Concurrent HashMap - why HashMap is faster in single thread environment?
* Parallel Stream vs CompletableFuture - which to prefer when
* 100,000+ records + 1000 records - is parallel stream good here

---

## **Microservices & Architecture**

* Diff between SOA and Microservices
* Microservices design patterns
* Scaling of microservices
* Disintegrating monolith to microservices
* API Gateway – why we need it
* Service registry – why we need it
* Horizontal scaling vs vertical scaling
* Kubernetes load management
* Config server

---

## **Security**

* Encryption algorithms
* Diff between OAuth and JWT token
* Purpose of secret key in JWT
* CSRF and CORS
* JWT token contents
* Which algorithm would you prefer (SHA256)
* OWASP and Veracode fixing
* HSM and token management

---

## **Database / SQL**

* What is PostgreSQL and how it differs from other SQL databases
* Cluster in SQL
* Database management for millions of data

---

## **Database Optimization**

* **How will you delete duplicate rows in a table except primary key?**
  - Using CTE with ROW_NUMBER():
  ```sql
  WITH CTE AS (
    SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY column1, column2 ORDER BY id) as rn
    FROM table_name
  )
  DELETE FROM CTE WHERE rn > 1;
  ```
  - Keep first occurrence (rn = 1), delete rest
  - Also use DISTINCT for SELECT, or add UNIQUE constraint

---

## **Hibernate / ORM**

* First-level vs second-level cache in Hibernate
* Pessimistic locking vs Optimistic locking in Hibernate
* Cascading types in Hibernate
* N+1 problem in Hibernate - how to overcome it
* Transaction isolation & propagation
* * How to handle transaction

---

## **Design Patterns**

* Strategy design pattern
* Fluent Interface pattern
* Facade design pattern
* Proxy design pattern
* Factory and Abstract Factory
* Builder design pattern
* SOLID principles with examples
* Creational design patterns - explain in detail

---

## **DevOps / Containers / Cloud**

* Dockerfile creation
* S2I (Source to Image)
* Kubernetes pods
* ConfigMap
* Helm charts
* Does Kubernetes have containers in it
* AWS scaling
* OpenShift
* NGINX - what is the purpose of this
* Explain the steps run behind CI/CD

---

## **Logging & Monitoring**

* Reducing increasing log file size in production
* How will monitor and secure your microservices application

---

## **System Design / Scalability**

* CAP theorem
* Kubernetes load handling
* Scaling and maintainability
* A frontend application needs to trigger processing for a very large number of orders (around 100,000). How would you design the API so that the system is scalable, secure, and avoids sending large payloads from the frontend?

---

## **Networking / Infrastructure**

* Any idea on TCP/IP and Security Layer
* NGINX - what is the purpose of this
