Use of Argo CD?
 - Argo CD is mainly for GitOps (deployments/config sync), not for logs.

Why in Azure - Azure Red Hat OpenShift?
 - That means Microsoft Azure + Red Hat together provide a managed OpenShift service.
 - Instead of you setting up OpenShift manually, Azure hosts it for you (scaling, security patches, cluster upgrades, integrations with Azure Monitor, etc.).

OCP4 = OpenShift Container Platform 4
 - It’s Red Hat’s Kubernetes-based platform for running containers and microservices.

Azure + OCP4:
 - Managed OpenShift cluster running inside Azure’s cloud.
